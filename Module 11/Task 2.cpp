/*Write a function that does the following task.


Consider a rat placed at (0, 0) in a square matrix of order N * N. It has to reach the destination at (N - 1, N - 1). Find if there is a path from source to destination, return true if there is any path, and return false otherwise.
The directions in which the rat can move are 'U'(up), 'D'(down), 'L' (left), 'R' (right). Value 0 at a cell in the matrix represents that it is blocked and rat cannot move to it while value 1 at a cell in the matrix represents that rat can travel through it.


Note: In a path, no cell can be visited more than one time. If the source cell is 0, the rat cannot move to any other cell.


Mention the time and space complexity of your solution.


Example 1:


Input:
N = 4
m[][] =
{{1, 0, 0, 0},
{1, 1, 0, 1},
{1, 1, 0, 0},
{0, 1, 1, 1}}


Output: true


Explanation:
The rat can reach the destination at (3, 3) from (0, 0) by two paths - DRDDRR and DDRDRR, when printed in sorted order we get DDRDRR DRDDRR.


Example 2:


Input:
N = 2
m[][] =
{{1, 0},
{1, 0}}


Output: false


Explanation:
No path exists and the destination cell is blocked.
